#### Accessing Custom Vision

Azure offers a specialized service for image recognition: Custom Vision on another address instead of Azure Cloud Portal. This service is highly user-friendly and is designed for the rapid and easy creation of custom image classification models.

Differing from the Azure Platform Portal, this Custom Vision can be access by navigating to the [Custom Vision Portal](https://www.customvision.ai/).

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Sign In or Sign Up**
    - If you already have an Azure account, you can sign in. 
2. **Create a New Project**
    - Click on the "New Project" button and fill in the details for your project, such as the name, description, and the resource you wish to use.
3. **Upload Images and Annotate**
    - After creating your project, you must upload images to train your model. 
    - To write your own script for uploading images and labels, please check the Azure Custom Vision official documents using the given APIs.
4. **Train the Model**
    - Once your images are uploaded and annotated, click on the "Train" button to start training your model. Setting the resources as you prefer.
5. **Evaluate the Model**
    - After the training is complete, you can see the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.
6. **Quick Test**
    - Use the "Quick Test" option to upload an image and quickly check the model's accuracy.
7. **Publish the Endpoint**
    - If you are satisfied with your model's performance, click on the "Publish" button to publish your model. During this publishing process, you will need to choose a resource and name your endpoint.
8. **Get Endpoint and Key**
    - Once published, you'll receive an Endpoint URL and a key. You can use this information for API calls within your application.

If you have an image URL:

https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/url

Set `Prediction-Key` Header to : `12861a3a15xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Set `Content-Type` Header to : `application/json`

Set Body to : `{"Url": "https://example.com/image.png"}`

If you have an image file:

https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/image

Set `Prediction-Key` Header to : `12861a3a1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Set `Content-Type` Header to : `application/octet-stream`

Set Body to : <image file>



Now that your Custom Vision model has been published and you have your endpoint URL and prediction key, you can start making API calls to classify new images.

Once your Custom Vision model is up and running, testing its API endpoints is crucial for ensuring it works as expected before you integrate it into your application. Below are step-by-step guides for testing your API using both image URLs and image files.

#### Testing with an Image URL

**Step 1: Install Required Software**

If you haven't already, install Python and the requests library.

```
bashCopy code
pip install requests
```

**Step 2: Prepare Python Script**

Create a Python script and add the following code:

```
pythonCopy codeimport requests
import json

# Endpoint and headers setup
endpoint_url = "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/url"
headers = {
    "Prediction-Key": "12861a3a15xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Image URL
payload = json.dumps({"Url": "https://example.com/image.png"})

# API call
response = requests.post(endpoint_url, headers=headers, data=payload)

# Output results
results = response.json()
print(results)
```

**Step 3: Run the Script**

Run the Python script. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the predicted labels and confidence scores.

#### Testing with an Image File

**Step 1: Install Required Software**

If you haven't already, install Python and the requests library.

```
bashCopy code
pip install requests
```

**Step 2: Prepare Python Script**

Create a Python script and add the following code:

```
pythonCopy codeimport requests

# Endpoint and headers setup
endpoint_url = "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/image"
headers = {
    "Prediction-Key": "12861a3a1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"
}

# Read the image file
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
with open(image_path, "rb") as image_data:
    # API call
    response = requests.post(endpoint_url, headers=headers, data=image_data)

# Output results
results = response.json()
print(results)
```

**Step 3: Run the Script**

Run the Python script. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the predicted labels and confidence scores.



### Using Postman to Test Your Custom Vision API

Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to send requests to your API endpoints and view responses. Below is a step-by-step guide to using Postman for testing your Custom Vision API.

#### Prerequisites

- Download and install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

#### Testing with an Image URL

**Step 1: Open Postman**

Open Postman and create a new request by clicking on the `New` button and then selecting `Request`.

**Step 2: Configure the Request**

- Set the HTTP method to `POST`.

- Enter your Custom Vision URL endpoint for image URL classification in the request URL field:
    `https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/url`

- In the 

    ```
    Headers
    ```

     tab, add the following headers:

    - `Prediction-Key`: `12861a3a15xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
    - `Content-Type`: `application/json`

**Step 3: Add Body**

Go to the `Body` tab, select `raw` and choose `JSON` from the dropdown. Then enter the following payload:

```
jsonCopy code{
  "Url": "https://example.com/image.png"
}
```

**Step 4: Send Request and Review Output**

Click the `Send` button to send the request. You should see the response at the bottom of the Postman window, which will include the predicted labels and their confidence scores.

#### Testing with an Image File

**Step 1: Open Postman**

Open Postman and create a new request by clicking on the `New` button and then selecting `Request`.

**Step 2: Configure the Request**

## Part II: Integration of Cloud AI Services



### Integrating Azure Custom Vision into Your Own Service

Once you've confirmed that your Custom Vision API is working correctly using either Python code or Postman, the next step is to integrate it into your own service or application. The key advantage of using Azure's Cloud AI services is the ease with which they can be scaled and integrated into various platforms and languages.

#### Requirements

- Working Custom Vision model with a published endpoint
- Prediction-Key for authentication
- Language-specific libraries or SDKs for making HTTP requests (like Pythonâ€™s `requests` or JavaScript's `fetch`)

#### Steps for Integration

##### Backend Integration:

1. **Initialize HTTP Client:**

    In your backend service, first initialize an HTTP client that you will use to communicate with the Azure API.

    ```
    pythonCopy code
    import requests
    ```

2. **Set Up Configuration:**

    Define constants or environment variables for the endpoint URL and the Prediction-Key.

    ```
    pythonCopy codePREDICTION_KEY = "12861a3a1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ENDPOINT_URL = "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/image"
    ```

3. **API Call Function:**

    Create a function that makes an API call to the Custom Vision service.

    ```
    pythonCopy codedef classify_image(image_data):
        headers = {
            "Prediction-Key": PREDICTION_KEY,
            "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"
        }
        response = requests.post(ENDPOINT_URL, headers=headers, data=image_data)
        return response.json()
    ```

4. **Integrate into Logic:**

    Integrate the above function where needed in your application logic. For example, you might call `classify_image` when a user uploads a new image.

    



### Creating a Server Using FastAPI to Integrate Azure Custom Vision

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's an excellent choice for wrapping your interactions with Azure Custom Vision into a RESTful API service.

#### Prerequisites

- Install FastAPI: `pip install fastapi`
- Install an ASGI server like Uvicorn: `pip install uvicorn`

#### Steps for Integration

##### Initialize Your FastAPI Project:

1. **Create a New Python File:**

    Create a new Python file for your FastAPI application, for example, `main.py`.

2. **Import FastAPI and Initialize:**

    ```
    pythonCopy codefrom fastapi import FastAPI
    
    app = FastAPI()
    ```

##### Create the Azure API Interaction Function:

You'll need the function to interact with Azure Custom Vision, similar to the one we discussed earlier. Let's assume you have a function called `classify_image(image_data)` that takes an image binary as input and returns Azure API's JSON response.

```
pythonCopy codeimport requests

PREDICTION_KEY = "12861a3a1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
ENDPOINT_URL = "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvision/v3.0/Prediction/projectname/classify/iterations/imagenetAzure/image"

def classify_image(image_data):
    headers = {
        "Prediction-Key": PREDICTION_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"
    }
    response = requests.post(ENDPOINT_URL, headers=headers, data=image_data)
    return response.json()
```

##### Create FastAPI Endpoints:

1. **Create an Endpoint for Classifying an Image:**

    You'll need to import FastAPI's `File` and `UploadFile` for file upload functionality.

    ```
    pythonCopy codefrom fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
    
    @app.post("/classify/")
    async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
        image_data = await file.read()
        result = classify_image(image_data)
        return result
    ```

This FastAPI endpoint listens to POST requests at `/classify/` and expects a file upload. The uploaded file is read into `image_data`, which is then sent to `classify_image()` for getting the classification result.

##### Run Your FastAPI Application:

1. **Run Using Uvicorn:**

    Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where `main.py` is located, and run:

    ```
    bashCopy code
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

You should see output indicating that the server is running. By default, it will be hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

##### Test Your FastAPI Service:

You can now use Postman or curl to send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify/` with a file attached to see if you get the expected classification result from Azure Custom Vision.

### Summary

By integrating Azure Custom Vision with FastAPI, you can create a robust, scalable, and flexible RESTful API service that not only interacts with Azure's powerful AI capabilities.





![Swagger UI](https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/4HhGQ6tj7Xkxdcq.png)





### Creating a SwaggerHub API for Your FastAPI Server and Viewing Documentation

SwaggerHub is a platform for API design and documentation. One of the key benefits of using FastAPI is its built-in support for generating interactive API documentation via Swagger UI, which can then be exported to SwaggerHub for more collaborative work on the API.

#### Prerequisites

- A running FastAPI service.
- An account on [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/).

#### Exporting Swagger JSON from FastAPI

FastAPI auto-generates Swagger documentation for your API. To access it, run your FastAPI project and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser. At this URL, you'll see the Swagger UI, providing an interactive interface to test your API.

To export the Swagger JSON:

1. On the Swagger UI interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`, you'll find a button at the top that says `Export -> JSON`.
2. Click it to download the Swagger JSON schema.

#### Importing Swagger JSON to SwaggerHub

1. **Login to SwaggerHub**: Open your browser and go to [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/). Log in or sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. **Create a New API**: On the dashboard, click on the `Create New` -> `API` button.
3. **Import the JSON File**: You'll see an option to import an API definition. Upload the downloaded Swagger JSON file here.
4. **Review and Save**: After uploading, you'll see your API documentation in a well-organized, interactive format. Review it and save it.

#### Collaboration and Versioning

1. **Invite Team Members**: You can invite team members to collaborate on your API by sharing the SwaggerHub API URL.
2. **Version Control**: SwaggerHub provides built-in version control. You can create new versions of your API as your project evolves.

#### Viewing Documentation

Once imported, your API documentation will be available in a user-friendly, interactive format. You can:

- View the list of API endpoints, models, and authentication methods.
- Test endpoints directly within the browser.
- Generate client SDKs in multiple languages.

## Part III: Deployment - Azure Cloud Deployment

------



##### [What is a container?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container) 

A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine. That isolation leverages [kernel namespaces and cgroupsopen_in_new](https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504), features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker makes these capabilities approachable and easy to use. To summarize, a container:

- Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
- Can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed to the cloud.
- Is portable (and can be run on any OS).
- Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc.

If you're familiar with `chroot`, then think of a container as an extended version of `chroot`. The filesystem comes from the image. However, a container adds additional isolation not available when using chroot.



##### [What is an image?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-an-image) 

A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configurations for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.





### Packaging Server as Docker Image and Pushing to Azure Container Registry

In this section of the tutorial, we'll walk through the process of packaging your FastAPI server as a Docker image and uploading it to the Azure Container Registry (ACR).

#### Prerequisites

- You should have Docker installed on your local machine.
- You should have Azure CLI (`az`) installed.
- Azure account and access to the Azure Portal.

#### Steps to Follow

##### 1. Dockerizing the FastAPI Application

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your FastAPI project.

    ```
    DockerfileCopy code# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.9-slim
    
    # Working directory
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app
    
    # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
    RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn
    
    # Run Uvicorn when the container launches
    CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
    ```

    Replace `main:app` with the appropriate import statement based on your FastAPI appâ€™s location.

2. **Build Docker Image**: Navigate to the folder containing your `Dockerfile` and run the following command.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    docker build -t fastapi_app .
    ```

3. **Test Locally**: After building the image, run it locally to test.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi_app
    ```

    Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see if your FastAPI application is running inside a Docker container.

##### 2. Pushing Image to Azure Container Registry

1. **Login to Azure Account**: Run the following command to login.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    az login
    ```

2. **Create a Container Registry**: Navigate to the Azure Portal, and create a new Azure Container Registry (ACR).

3. **Authenticate Docker with ACR**: Replace `<acr_name>` with the name of your Azure Container Registry.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    az acr login --name <acr_name>
    ```

4. **Tag the Image**: Before pushing, tag your Docker image using the ACR login server name which you can find in the Azure Portal under your ACR resource.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    docker tag fastapi_app <acr_login_server>/fastapi_app:v1
    ```

5. **Push Docker Image**: Push the Docker image to the ACR.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    docker push <acr_login_server>/fastapi_app:v1
    ```

 we covered how to Dockerize a FastAPI application and push it to the Azure Container Registry. This containerized application is now ready to be deployed to various Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service for Containers.

With your FastAPI server now available as a Docker image in the Azure Container Registry, you can easily deploy it in a scalable and manageable way, taking full advantage of Azure's cloud infrastructure.





### Deploying Docker Image from Azure Container Registry to Azure Services

Once your Docker image is successfully pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR), the next step is to deploy it to an Azure service. In this part of the tutorial, we'll cover two options for deploying your containerized FastAPI application: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure App Service.

#### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI (`az`) installed and authenticated.
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) with the Docker image pushed.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service set up (depending on where you're deploying).

#### Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

1. **Create an AKS Cluster**: If you haven't already, create an AKS cluster in the Azure portal.

2. **Configure kubectl**: Connect to your AKS cluster by running the following command. Replace `<resource-group>` and `<aks-cluster-name>` with your AKS resource group and cluster name respectively.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <aks-cluster-name>
    ```

3. **Pull Image from ACR to AKS**: Create a Kubernetes secret to pull your image from your private ACR.

    ```
    bashCopy code
    kubectl create secret docker-registry my-acr-auth --docker-server <acr_login_server> --docker-username <acr_username> --docker-password <acr_password>
    ```

4. **Deploy to AKS**: Create a YAML file, say `k8s-deployment.yaml`, and add the following content. Replace placeholders like `<acr_login_server>` and `my-acr-auth` accordingly.

    ```
    yamlCopy codeapiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: fastapi-app-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: fastapi-app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: fastapi-app
            image: <acr_login_server>/fastapi_app:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: my-acr-auth
    ```

    Run `kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml` to deploy your FastAPI application.

#### Deploying to Azure App Service

1. **Create Web App**: If you haven't already, create a new Web App for Containers in the Azure Portal.
2. **Configure App Service**: In the Web App settings, go to the `Container settings` section. Choose `Azure Container Registry` and select your image and tag.
3. **Save and Restart**: Click `Save` and then restart your Web App.
4. **Check Deployment**: Navigate to the URL provided by the Web App to check if your FastAPI application is live.



We've shown you how to deploy a FastAPI application stored as a Docker image in Azure Container Registry to both Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure App Service. You can choose the method that best fits your scalability and management needs.

By now, you should have a comprehensive understanding of how to build, containerize, and deploy a FastAPI application on Azure, taking full advantage of the robust features offered by Azure services.

### Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions for Automatic Deployment

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) enable developers to be more agile, catch bugs early, and deliver value faster. In this section, we'll set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build, test, and deploy our FastAPI application whenever there is a new commit to the GitHub repository.

#### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository containing your FastAPI application.
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) where your Docker image will be stored.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service where your application will be deployed.

#### Steps to Follow

##### 1. Create GitHub Secrets for Azure Authentication

1. Open your GitHub repository and navigate to `Settings > Secrets > New repository secret`.
2. Create secrets for Azure Container Registry (ACR) credentials and Azure login details:
    - `AZURE_REGISTRY_USERNAME`: ACR username
    - `AZURE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: ACR password
    - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Azure service principal in JSON format.

##### 2. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. In your GitHub repository, create a new file under `.github/workflows/`, say `ci-cd.yaml`.
2. Add the following YAML code into the `ci-cd.yaml` file.

```
yamlCopy codename: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  AZURE_REGISTRY_URL: <acr_login_server>
  APP_NAME: fastapi_app

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Login to Azure Container Registry
      run: echo "${{ secrets.AZURE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}" | docker login ${{ env.AZURE_REGISTRY_URL }} -u ${{ secrets.AZURE_REGISTRY_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
      
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t ${{ env.AZURE_REGISTRY_URL }}/${{ env.APP_NAME }}:v1 .
        docker push ${{ env.AZURE_REGISTRY_URL }}/${{ env.APP_NAME }}:v1

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Azure login
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        
    - name: Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service
      run: |
        az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <aks-cluster-name>
        kubectl set image deployment/fastapi-app-deployment fastapi-app=${{ env.AZURE_REGISTRY_URL }}/${{ env.APP_NAME }}:v1
```

Replace placeholders like `<acr_login_server>`, `<resource-group>`, and `<aks-cluster-name>` with your specific Azure details.

1. Save and commit the `ci-cd.yaml` file to your repository.

#### Summary

With this GitHub Actions workflow, every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline will build a new Docker image, push it to Azure Container Registry, and update the image running on your Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure App Service.
